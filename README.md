 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a travel planner application. The application should allow users to create a list of destinations they want to visit, and then plan a trip that includes all of the destinations. The application should also allow users to track their expenses and share their trips with others.

## Design

The application will be built using the Flask framework. The following HTML files will be needed:

* `index.html`: The home page of the application. This page will allow users to create a new trip or view their existing trips.
* `create_trip.html`: This page will allow users to create a new trip.
* `view_trip.html`: This page will allow users to view the details of a trip, including the destinations, expenses, and shared users.
* `edit_trip.html`: This page will allow users to edit the details of a trip.
* `delete_trip.html`: This page will allow users to delete a trip.

The following routes will be needed:

* `/`: The home page of the application.
* `/create_trip`: The route to create a new trip.
* `/view_trip/<int:trip_id>`: The route to view the details of a trip.
* `/edit_trip/<int:trip_id>`: The route to edit the details of a trip.
* `/delete_trip/<int:trip_id>`: The route to delete a trip.

The application will use a SQLite database to store the trip data. The following tables will be needed:

* `trips`: This table will store the basic information about each trip, such as the name, start date, and end date.
* `destinations`: This table will store the destinations for each trip.
* `expenses`: This table will store the expenses for each trip.
* `shared_users`: This table will store the users who have been shared a trip.

## Implementation

The application can be implemented using the following steps:

1. Create a new Flask application.
2. Create the HTML files for the application.
3. Create the routes for the application.
4. Connect the application to the SQLite database.
5. Create the tables in the SQLite database.
6. Test the application.

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to a production server using the following steps:

1. Create a new virtual environment for the application.
2. Install the required dependencies for the application.
3. Copy the application files to the production server.
4. Configure the application to use the production database.
5. Start the application.
